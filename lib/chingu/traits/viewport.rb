module Chingu
  module Traits
    #
    # A chingu trait providing velocity and acceleration logic. 
    # Adds parameters: velocity_x/y, acceleration_x/y and modifies self.x / self.y
    # Also keeps previous_x and previous_y which is the x, y before modification.
    # Can be useful for example collision detection
