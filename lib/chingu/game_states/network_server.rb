module Chingu
  module GameStates  
    #
    # A game state that acts server in a multiplayer game, suitable for smaller/middle sized games.
    # Used in combination with game state NetworkClient.
    #
    # Uses nonblocking polling TCP and YAML to communicate. 
    # If your game state inherits from NetworkClient you'll have the following methods available:
    #
    #   start(ip, port)                         # Start server listening on ip:port
    #   send_data(socket, data)                 # Send raw data on the network, nonblocking
    #   send_msg(socket, whatever ruby data)    # Will get YAML'd and sent to server
    #   broadcast_msg(whatever ruby data)       # Send stuff to all connected clients, buffered and dispatched each gametick
    #   handle_incoming_connections             # Nonblocking accept of incoming connections from clients
    #   handle_incoming_data(max_size)          # Nonblocking read of incoming server data

    #   
    # The following callbacks can be overwritten to add your game logic:
    #
    #   on_connect(socket)        # when the TCP connection to the server is opened
    #   on_disconnect(socket)     # when server dies or disconnects you
    #   on_data(socket, data)     # when raw data arrives from server, if not overloaded this will unpack and call on_msg
    #   on_msg(socket, msg)       # an incoming msgs, could be a ruby hash or array or whatever datastructure you've chosen to send from server
    #   on_start                  # called when socket is listening and ready
    #   on_start_error(msg)       # callback for any error during server setup process
    #
    # Usage:
    #   ServerState < Chingu::GameStates::NetworkServer
    #     # incoming client/connection...
    #     def on_connect(socket)
    #       send_msg(:cmd => :ping, :timestamp => Gosu::milliseconds)
    #     end
    #     
    #     def on_msg(socket, msg)
    #       if msg[:cmd] == :pong
    #         latency = Gosu::milliseconds - msg[:timestamp]
    #         puts "Server/Client roundtrip #{latency}ms"
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   push_game_state ServerState.new(:ip => "127.0.0.1", :port => 7778).start
    #
    #  NetworkServer works mostly like NetworkClient with a few differences
    #  - since a server handles many sockets (1 for each connected client) all callbacks first argument is 'socket'
    #  - same with outgoing packets, send_data and send_msgs first argument is socket.
    #
    # A good idea is to have a socket-ivar in your Player-model and a Player.find_by_socket(socket)
